# Local Encrypted Chat

Local Encrypted Chat is a simple chat application that allows users to communicate securely on a local network. The application is built using C# and uses the .NET Framework for encryption.

## Introduction

Local Encrypted Chat allows users to send and receive messages over a local network without the risk of interception or eavesdropping. The application uses symmetric-key encryption to ensure that only the intended recipient can read the message. The following technologies are used:

- **C#**: programming language used to create the application
- **.NET Framework**: used to perform encryption and decryption

## Installation

To run Local Encrypted Chat, you need to have Visual Studio and the .NET Framework installed on your machine. Here's how you can set up Local Encrypted Chat:

1. Clone the repository to your machine.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio.
3. Build and run the application.

## Usage

Once you have set up Local Encrypted Chat, you can use the following features:

- **Send and receive messages**: you can send messages to other users on the same local network, and receive messages from them in real time.
- **Encrypt and decrypt messages**: messages are encrypted using a symmetric-key algorithm, and can only be decrypted by the intended recipient.
- **View chat history**: the application stores the chat history, allowing you to view previous messages.
